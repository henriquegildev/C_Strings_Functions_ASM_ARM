# C Strings Functions in ASM ARM
 This repo serves the purpose of storing source code for string related functions in C, written in Assembly ARM.
 Me and Gabriel Gomes wrote this code for a class, Computer Architectures, during my Computer Science Degree (or as it is called in Portuguese, "Engenharia Inform√°tica" which translates to Informatic Engineering).

The code is rough, is not as efficient as it could be, I don't have time at the moment to fix it. If you somehow stumble upon this code and find fixes to it, feel free to add them.

Thanks for reading.
